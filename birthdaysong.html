    <h2><p> I was born on March 4 2001. The song that was #1 on the week I was born was "Stutter" by Joe. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGY_Qqr2Lm0" target="_blank">"Stutter"</a> The song and video refers to Joe's girlfriend, who comes home early in the morning while he wakes up and they discuss where she had been. She's "stuttering" because it seems she is lying to him about having an affair. Joe's close friend, portrayed by rapper Mystikal, follows and spies on her while she sleeps with another man in a motel, called the "Easy Rest-In", taping it on video. After she leaves, she and Mystikal are driving next to each other on the road, while they discuss the bad situation.</p></h2>
